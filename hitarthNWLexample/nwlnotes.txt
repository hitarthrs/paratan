Notes to calculate NWL in mirror geometry
-----------------------------------------
Assume you only want NWL as a 1-D distribution along the axis of the mirror

Basic concept is:
1) Create a model with the plasma, FWarmor, and dummy outside regions only (all cells have material=void)
2) run openmc and write a surface source for neutrons on the plasma/FWarmor interface surfaces
3) Bin the neutrons into the desired mirror axis intervals to get counts/interval as well as EnergyAverage and RadiusAverage for that interval
4) Convert counts to proper NWL units of MW and calculate the area of that interval to arrive at MW/m2

Files that perform the above steps using actual Realta geometry and Pfus=4.62 MW
(assumes all E=14.1 MeV neutrons in plot file):

runNWLmirror11void.py
extractSurfSourceCoord.py
-currently does not extract energy of each neutron
-there is now a better method for extracting data from the surface source but I didn't implement it
binCylSurfSource1D.py
-uses dataframes
testCountsBinnedRadius.txt
-data file created from binCylSurfSource1D.py outputs
plotnwlVSaxialposition11.gp
